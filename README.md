Running node computer_vs.js will simulate a game between two computers, printing out each move and the winner.

Running node play.js will allow you play against a computer.

Computer does not have AI, it only places a piece into a random column that isn't full.

BUGS: making an invalid move (trying to place a piece into a full column or entering something that isn't a number 1-7) will basically break the game, as you will not place a piece on the board but the computer will.
